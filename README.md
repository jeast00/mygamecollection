# My Game Collection
 A Sinatra app that allows a user to create an account, can edit, or delete their account, and will allow the user to add games to their account as a collection


 ## Installation

Make sure the repo has been cloned and forked on an IDE before running the application.

In the terminal, type:

    $ bundle install

This will install all of the gems needed to run the application

After that, type:

    $ shotgun

This will allow you to open up a browser copying and pasting the local host address which should start with http


## Usage

Instructions:

Once 'shotgun' has starting running and the local host address is available and
has been copied and pasted to the domain browser of your choice, you will be
able to see a screen with the title 'My Game Collection'.

Since the user is a first time user, the user will need to sign up.

Once the user has signed up for an account, the user will have the ability to go
to their account, or logout.

Once the user is in their account, they will have choices to add a game, see their
collection, edit their account, and delete their account.

Once the user adds a game to their account, they will have choices to add another game,
edit the game and delete the game.

Have fun with this application!

## Development

There was no local testing for this application.  This application was built from the ground up and tested within the terminal to ensure the code was properly working.  This application was built from the ground up with the help of countless hours of google searching, the inspiration of learning to code with Flatiron School, and the never ending support from students and staff.
